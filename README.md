# TryToCreateAGraphAndFuzzyApp

I create this so that I can create a graph using pyplot easier (atleast that is what I plan to do).
But it is hard to use using the console app, I actually plan to do a form app (or whatever version) but I am too lazy (Yeah!).

To be honest, I won't use it, it is really hard to use, I did rather code using pyplot myself to do graph, that is more easier.
